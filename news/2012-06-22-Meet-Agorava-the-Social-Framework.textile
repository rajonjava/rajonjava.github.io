Did you ever looked for a nice solution in java to authenticate your users with their Twitter, Facebook or LinkedIn account ? Have you ever looked for a nice way to post tweets or Facebook updates from your Java application? Do you need to read your timeline or perform a search on a Social Media services from Java EE web application? If you answered yes to one of these questions Agorava is (or will be soon) the right answer to your needs.
Agorava is the missing framework to deal with Social Media based on OAuth 1.0a and OAuth 2.0. It provides a way to authenticate on Social Media, use APIs and map JSON answers to Java pojo. It'll have multiple implementations (like CDI, Java SE, JSR 330 supporting framework and others) to support your needs. Right now the only implementation is based on CDI but we'll provide others in the coming months.

h3. Agorava genesis

Agorava's short history is important because it helps to understand the goals of our team. In March 2011 the project Seam Social was launched. This project was a collection of CDI beans and extension to support Social Network consuming. It lived inside Seam 3 project which was an ambitious JBoss project aimed to provide a rich ecosystem for Java EE 6 thru CDI extensions. For all kind of reasons we won't develop here, Seam 3 project was stopped at the end of 2011 to create a new project around CDI ecosystem : "Apache Deltaspike":https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/DeltaSpike/Temporary+Documentation (merging Seam 3, Apache CODI and others initiatives).
In parallel of this event, a few people launched a JCP proposal on Social Media : "Java Social JSR 357":http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=357. Projects like Seam Social or "DaliCore":http://java.net/projects/dalicore were main influencers for this proposal. This proposal was voted down for all kind of reasons, but mainly because there wasn't a real proof of concept (an implementation) behind it.
So the conjunction of these 2 stories brought us to create a new project : start from Seam Social code to provide an implementation for Java Social with the goal to go back to JCP in the future. This project is also a experiment to answer the problem and challenges in creating a standard API for Social Media API for Java platform. Thus Agorava is born


h3. But most Social Media already have their own APIs. So why do we reinvent the wheel?

Yes it's true, but these social APIs are almost always in Javascript only and if itâ€™s available in Java,  mostly its created by a third part or its build for one or few particular Social Media. So they are ok if you want to deal with GUI or simple manipulation. If you need to extend functionalities (crawl Twitter followers for instance or perform full text search on your Facebook Timeline) or build a mashup between different services those JS API would show their limit quickly.
Having a vendor free solution to deal with these Services is also an advantage, we'll try to implement all the available public APIs and provide similar functionalities across "all Social Media".

h3. Agorava is already alive and active!

Agorava can be used right now. You can test our demo application "Socializer":http://socializer.agorava.cloudbees.net/ or fork the "Socializer project on Github":https://github.com/agorava/agorava-socializer and run it with a simple @mvn -Prun@.
You already have some documentation on our "wiki":https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/AGOVA to start hacking our code so feel free to try it!
Agorava project is live and growing day by day! It also have "User Group":https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/agorava-dev for anyone like to post doubts or know the progress of the project 

h3. Project roadmap

Right now we're aiming a 0.5.0 release (the 0.5.0 SNAPSHOT is fully functional) during the summer. This version will be focused on CDI implementation only. Main objective of 0.5.0 are:
 
* Support stateless architecture (right now an http session is needed to store user Oauth Tokens)

Normally (except if people are ready to contribute and are not afraid of refactoring for version 1.0.0), we won't work on existing modules (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn) since API could change in version 1.0.0 when we'll integrate JAX-RS client framework.

Objective for 1.0.0 are:

* Change REST engine for JAX-RS 2.0 client framework
* If necessary implement our own OAuth implementation on JAX-RS client Framework
* Provide compatibility with Weld-OSGi
* Java SE implementation
* JSR 330 specific API and implementation (Guice or Spring)
* Finished Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook Modules
* New modules?

h3. Project Sponsors

On this road we are not alone. Organizations help us every day to make Agorava a reality and a success. So we'd like to thanks :

* "Ippon Technologies":http://blog.ippon.fr (my employer) a French Consulting company that agreed for giving me time to work on Seam Social and now on Agorava
* JBoss (Red Hat) who hosted Seam Social and helped Agorava launch and continue to support us every day with Jira, Confluence and good advice. Special thanks to Jason, Pete, Lincoln and Dan.
* The JCP. Ok they voted down our JSR proposal but most of their critics were helpful and lead us to start Agorava. We'll get back to them soon.
* Spring Source. Spring Social was the inspirer of Seam Social. I also borrowed a lot of code from Spring Social for Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook connectors. Thank you guys.
